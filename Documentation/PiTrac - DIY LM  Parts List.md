**PiTrac \- DIY LM  Parts Lists**

**Computing Hardware:**

| Quantity | Hardware | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) and power supply, 4 GB minimum, 8 FB recommended. | Getting a bundled kit with the Pi and power supply and some other things can be economical if you don’t have any Pi-related stuff yet. |
| 1 | [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and power supply, 4 GB minimum.  It may also make sense for a little more money just to get a second Pi 5\. |  |
| 1 | [Pimoroni NVMe Base for Raspberry Pi 5 \- PIM699](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5845) ((optional, but recommended for speed and longevity).   [This board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CQ4D2C9S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or the 
Geekworm M901 PCIe to M.2 HAT Key-M NVMe SSD PIP PCIe Peripheral Board for Raspberry Pi 5 Support M.2 2230/2242/2260/2280 SSD works well, too. | For the Pi 5, this allows use of an NVMe memory drive instead of an MicroSD card. |
| 1 | An [NVMe solid state (SSD) memory drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BGFRZDTB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (optional, but recommended for speed and longevity) | Typically with an M.2 M key edge connector, in the 2230 and 2242 form factors.  Should probably get at least 256 GB capacity. |
| 2 | Micro SD cards (to bootstrap the Pi’s). | We recommend 64GB size |
| 1 | An Active Cooler fan for the Pi 5 (optional) | The Pi 5 can get pretty hot if you’re doing a lot of big compiles on it.  If so, having a cooler seems like decent insurance. |

**Camera and Lighting Hardware:**

| 2  | [Raspberry Pi Global Shutter Camera – CS Lens Mount](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5702) | The cameras currently used by the LM.  They do not come with lenses (see below) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | [Raspberry Pi 5 FPC Camera Cable \- 22-pin 0.5mm to 15-pin 1mm \- 300mm long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5819) | The current Pi Cameras have a CSI cable that needs a conversion to fit into the smaller CSI ports on the Pi 5\.  The 200mm should probably work as well. |
|  | [200 mm Flex Cable for Pi 4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2087) | This likely comes with most Pi Cameras, so may not be necessary |
| 2 | [6mm 3MP Wide Angle Lens for Raspberry Pi HQ Camera \- 3MP](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4563) | Wide angle lens for the Pi GS cameras (which come without a lens) |
| 1 | [1" x 1", Optical Cast Plastic IR Longpass Filter](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/1quot-x-1quot-optical-cast-plastic-ir-longpass-filter/5421/) (1.5mm nominal thickness) | Blocks visible light below 850nm from entering the Camera 2 sensor |
|  |  |  |

NOTE \- this device can get very hot if left constantly on for even a few seconds.  PiTrac just uses it in short pulses. |
| 1 | [Aclorol USB COB LED Strip Lights for TV 5V USB Powered LED Tape Lights Daylight White 6.56FT 320Leds/M 6000K COB Flexible Light Strip TV Led Backlight for Bedroom Under Cabinet Kitchen DIY](https://www.amazon.com/Aclorol-Powered-Daylight-Flexible-Backlight/dp/B0D1FYV3LM/ref=asc_df_B0D1FYV3LM?mcid=70db06b6e26231f3961ef52c9615b991&hvocijid=2003913134214569652-B0D1FYV3LM-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2003913134214569652&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028778&hvtargid=pla-2281435177378&psc=1) | LED strip for lighting the teed-up ball- long enough to double it for more light. 
NOTE - The Strip should produce NO infrared light, or else it will interfere with the IR strobing that the system uses.
|

**Power-Related Parts:**

| 1 | LED Driver, 12-26V, Output Current DC 3600mA, such as: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832563139779.html NOTE - Also need a power-plug for some of these drivers that just come with power wires.  For the US, see, e.g., [this](https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTozNDg3Njk4NDA4NzA1MDMwOjE3MzY4NjY2NTk6c3BfZGV0YWlsX3RoZW1hdGljOjMwMDE1OTE3MDMwOTgwMjo6Ojo&url=%2Fdp%2FB0CX1N6QH9%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_2%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB0CX1N6QH9%26pd_rd_w%3DGQ1BX%26content-id%3Damzn1.sym.f2f1cf8f-cab4-44dc-82ba-0ca811fb90cc%26pf_rd_p%3Df2f1cf8f-cab4-44dc-82ba-0ca811fb90cc%26pf_rd_r%3DQR7BKYRYDGSHKFAMD4S7%26pd_rd_wg%3DJjPV7%26pd_rd_r%3Dacea77bd-162b-41bb-9994-5c2cf82355d8%26s%3Dhi%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWxfdGhlbWF0aWM) NOTE:  At this point in time, it's probably safe (and better) to get a higher-power LED driver that can over-voltage the LED.  For example, [a 3000mA 18-34V driver](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/2251832563139779.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt) | Driver for LED strobe array. Because of the short pulses that are used in the LM, a much smaller (and cheaper) driver may also work, possibly even a non-constant-current driver.   |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | A 5V USB-B power supply with a male micro USB connector  | This is currently necessary to run the Connectro Board.  The supply is used as an isolated, independent (downstream of a transformer) power plane to try to keep the Pi’s and the Pi Camera safe. |

| 1 | Power Strip | A relatively short power strip that is compact enough to fit into the enclosure. 10” or less, and with some type of power filtering to protect the rest of the components |

[^1]:  Stainless Steel seems to be stronger than black carbon steel, though both can work.  Especially in the stiffer PLA material, stainless is preferable because black carbon can break if torqued too much..

**NOTE \-The following is a work in progress \- Version 2 of the Enclosure is not complete**

**Enclosure Ver. 2 \- Hardware \- Bolts and Nuts:[^2]**

| Quantity | Hardware | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2 | M3 x 8 self-tapping screws | AC Power inlet plug (side of base box) (if using a PSU, or potentially putting a LED driver inside the basebox. |
| 2 | M3 x 8 self-tapping screws | Secures the end-cap of the base box into the rest of the box |
| 2 | M3 x 8 machine screws | Secures PSU to bottom of base box.  No PSU will generally be used if using the original Connector Board variant of the Version 2 enclosure. |
| 3 | M3 x 10 machine screws (or x 8\) | Secures PSU to the side of the base box (If using the new PiTrac Compute Board).   NOTE \- in order to efficiently use screw assortment sets, either x8 or x10 screws can be used.  There is space in the PSU for either, so just use what you have more of. |

| 2 x 4 | M3 x 6 self-tapping screws | Secures Pi Microcontrollers to Backplane (Only if using Compute Board variant and Pi Microcontrollers instead of Compute Modules |
| 4 | M4 x 12  self-tapping screws | Secures tower (feet) to top of base box.  Could use longer screws if they don’t interfere with the power supply. |
| 2 | Pan head M4\*12 or \*16 self-tapping screws  | For the top of the Shank Shield.  Pan-head is preferred in order to avoid countersinking, but could also use flat-head. |

| 4 | M4 x 12 | Secures Case Cover to the top of the Basebox |
| 6 12 (variant) | Self-tapping M2.5 x 8 screws | Secure Compute Board to the Backplane of the Tower.  If using the original Connector Board and two Raspberry Pi’s, will need 12, not 6 screws. |
| 5 | Heat Shrink Ring-type Wire Connectors | [Ring connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYM3J44Q?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) to connect the various power supply wires to the screw terminals of the PSU. |
