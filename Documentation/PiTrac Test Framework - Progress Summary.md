# PiTrac Boost Test Framework Implementation - Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Test Environment Setup
- ✅ Enhanced `run-tests-windows.ps1` script with improved parameters and merged with `run-tests-windows-updated.ps1` 
- ✅ Added `-BoostTests`, `-Verbose`, `-Coverage` and `-TestFilter` parameters to Windows test runner
- ✅ Enhanced `run-tests-linux.sh` with equivalent parameters
- ✅ Created `build-and-run-enhanced.sh` with improved argument handling
- ✅ Created `setup-code-coverage.ps1` for setting up code coverage tools
- ✅ Created enhanced CMake configuration with code coverage support

### Test Implementation
- ✅ Created `boost_tests_enhanced.cpp` with more comprehensive test cases:
  - Tests for relative error calculations 
  - Tests for vector math operations
  - Tests for image processing functionality
  - Tests for configuration file loading
  - Tests for geometry calculations
  - Tests for a simplified version of the main processing pipeline

### CI/CD Integration
- ✅ Created `ci-test-integration.ps1` for Windows CI integration
- ✅ Created `ci-test-integration.sh` for Linux CI integration
- ✅ Created example GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- ✅ Added JUnit-compatible test report generation

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated `PiTrac Test Setup.md` documentation with new testing capabilities
- ✅ Added code coverage documentation
- ✅ Added CI/CD integration documentation

## Remaining Tasks

### Test Implementation
- [ ] Add more specialized tests for critical PiTrac functionality
- [ ] Create mock objects for external dependencies to improve test isolation
- [ ] Add performance benchmark tests to measure algorithm efficiency

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Test the GitHub Actions workflow in a real CI environment
- [ ] Add badge to README.md to show test status

### Additional Features
- [ ] Create test data generation scripts for repeatable tests
- [ ] Implement mutation testing to evaluate test quality
- [ ] Integrate memory leak detection with the test framework

## Usage Instructions

### Running Boost Tests on Windows
```powershell
# Run all Boost tests
.\run-tests-windows.ps1 -BoostTests

# Run specific tests
.\run-tests-windows.ps1 -BoostTests -TestFilter="SampleTest"

# Run with verbose logging
.\run-tests-windows.ps1 -BoostTests -Verbose

# Run with code coverage analysis
.\run-tests-windows.ps1 -BoostTests -Coverage
```

### Running Boost Tests on Linux
```bash
# Run all Boost tests
./run-tests-linux.sh --boost-tests

# Run specific tests
./run-tests-linux.sh --boost-tests --test-filter=SampleTest

# Run with verbose logging
./run-tests-linux.sh --boost-tests --verbose

# Run with code coverage analysis
./run-tests-linux.sh --boost-tests --coverage
```

### Running All Tests for CI/CD
```powershell
# Windows
.\ci-test-integration.ps1

# Linux
./ci-test-integration.sh
```

## Maintaining the Test Environment

### Cleaning Up Test Files

We've added cleanup scripts to help maintain the test environment:

```powershell
# Windows: Clean temporary files and coverage reports
.\clean-test-environment.ps1

# Clean only coverage reports
.\clean-test-environment.ps1 -RemoveCoverageOnly

# Clean only temporary build files
.\clean-test-environment.ps1 -RemoveTempOnly

# Remove all test directories and start fresh
.\clean-test-environment.ps1 -RemoveAll
```

For Linux:

```bash
# Linux: Clean temporary files and coverage reports
./clean-test-environment.sh

# Clean only coverage reports
./clean-test-environment.sh --coverage-only

# Clean only temporary build files
./clean-test-environment.sh --temp-only

# Remove all test directories and start fresh
./clean-test-environment.sh --all
```
